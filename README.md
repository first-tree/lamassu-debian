Lamassu install script for Ubuntu 14.04
============================================

This is a modified install script for the Lamassu administration and backend
servers for the *two-way Bitcoin machines with Santa Tirso stand*.

The upstream script is for Ubuntu 14.04 only and is located [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naconner/lamassu-install/two-way/install).

And documented in this [page](http://support.lamassu.is/support/solutions/articles/1000068000--start-here-lamassu-admin-installation).

This modified script supports Ubuntu 14.04 machines.  Additionally,
it runs the server processes as unprivileged user accounts instead of as root,
and applies several other fixes to make it more robust.
